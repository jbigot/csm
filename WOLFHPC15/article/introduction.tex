\begin{itemize}
\item DSL interest: simplified HPC programming + perf
\item DSL limits: Lots of DSLs difficult to write, to maintain, to make portable etc.
\item Components introduction, this paper takes a first example of DSL to components
\item The domain targeted is multi-stencil simulations
\item Contributions: DSL to components try + agnostic coarse grain DSL for multi-stencil programs
\item Outline
