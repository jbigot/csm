\begin{itemize}
\item DSL interest: simplified HPC programming + perf
\item A DSL for multi-stencil simulations + motivation fluid dynamics + bolzman + ...
\item DSL limits: Lots of DSLs difficult to write, to maintain, to make portable etc.
\item Components introduction, this paper takes a first example of DSL to components
\item Contributions: agnostic coarse grain DSL for multi-stencil programs + DSL to components try
\item Outline
