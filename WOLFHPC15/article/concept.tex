\subsection{Multi-stencil programs}
\label{sect:multistencil}
%----------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item textual introduction on the problem, what is a stencil + example. What is a real simulation (more than one stencil and additionnal computations). 
\item Existing solutions with prgramming freedom (instead of PETSc and Trilinos) = stencil compilers which give optimized code for one stencil code. Thus, for distributed memory and HPC, still have to use MPI between optimized codes to get an overall parallelization of the simulation.
\item Short definition of a multi-stencil program and its computations (cite research report for more details)
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{Component models}
%----------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
\item Interest of component models, references.
\item Textual definition of a component, a port (use, provide and use-multiple), (an interface) and a component assembly
\end{itemize}
