Conclusion :
\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-stencil formalism
\item MSL and MSC

Perspectives :
\begin{itemize}
\item Dump to OpenMP for comparison
\item MSC to dynamic scheduler (starPU, XKaapi)
\item Formalization and abstraction of the data management in component-based applications
\item Parallel component language
