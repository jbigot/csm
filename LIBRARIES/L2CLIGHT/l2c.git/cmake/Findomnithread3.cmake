# Find the omnithread library and include dir
#
# The following variables are set:
# omnithread3_FOUND        - When false, don't try to use omnithread
# omnithread3_INCLUDE_DIR  - omnithread include directory
# omnithread3_INCLUDE_DIRS - All directories to include to use omnithread (including dependancies)
# omnithread3_LIBRARY      - The omnithread library
# omnithread3_LIBRARIES    - All libraries to link against to use omnithread (including dependancies)

#### Find paths
#
# OMNI_DIR can be used to make it simpler to find the various include
# directories and compiled libraries when omniORB was not installed in the
# usual/well-known directories (e.g. because you made an in tree-source
# compilation or because you installed it in an "unusual" directory).
# Just set OMNI_DIR to point to your specific installation directory.
#
# the OMNI_DIR environment variable (as opposed to the OMNI_DIR cmake variable)
# is also used to search for an omniORB installation.
#
# WARNING: The order of precedence is the following
#    1/ when set OMNI_DIR (the cmake variable)
#    2/ when set OMNI_DIR (the environment variable)
#    3/ the default system path
# This precedence order goes against the usual pratice and default behavior
# of cmake's FIND_* macros. For more on this debate see e.g.
#     http://www.mail-archive.com/kde-buildsystem@kde.org/msg00589.html

#### some libs installed by omniorb
# omnithread    - checked for here: portable thread support
# omniORB4      - depends on us:    base CORBA support
# omniDynamic4  - depends on us:    dynamic features
# COS4          - depends on us:    stubs and skeletons for the COS service interfaces
# COSDynamic4   - depends on us:    dynamic stubs for the COS service interfaces
# omniCodeSets4 - depends on us:    extra code sets for string transformation
# omnisslTP     - depends on us:    SSL transport (built if OpenSSL is available
