 * The life cycle of components is represented by a state machine with the following states: INEXISTANT, CREATED, CONFIGURED, ACTIVATED.
 * When it's build using its constructor, a component is in the CREATED state.
 * The CONFIGURED state means that no more "set" should be called on the component and that it should be ready for access to the properties it has exposed.
 * The ACTIVATED state means that all components are at least CONFIGURED and that this instance can start using the properties it imports.
 * The DESTROYABLE state is deprecated, it has no clearly defined meaning except for the fact that the destructor is likely to be called soon.
